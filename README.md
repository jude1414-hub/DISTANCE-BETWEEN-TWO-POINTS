## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula

import math

x1, y1 = 4, 2
x2, y2 = 10, 6

distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

print(f"{distance:.2f}")
